                    <p>
                        Sick of that reccurring pain in your shoulder blade or lower back? Frustrated that you can’t get
                        up off the floor easily
                        anymore? Suffering from tension headaches on a regular basis? Shoulder or hip mobility limiting
                        you
                        from hitting a PR on that
                        lift? Can’t turn your neck without it hurting?
                    </p>

                    <p> Active Alignment was designed for you. The person that is ready to take charge of their life and
                        say enough is enough.
                        Pain and limited functional mobility do not need to limit you from living your best life and
                        doing
                        all the things you love
                        to do. Active Alignment utilizes a comprehensive assessment and treatment approach, looking at
                        the body as a whole
                        to provide you with the tools
                        needed to continue toward achieving your goals.

                <ul class="mt-lg-5">
                    <li>A diagnosis. The evaluation and assessment that occur are to help clue me into what muscles
                        and structures of the body are involved and are not performing as well as they could be.
                        If the evaluation and assessment point to a more serious issue, a Physician, Physical Therapist,
                        or Chiropractor may be needed to provide a medical diagnosis. I can help determine
                        when such referral may be needed.</li>
                    <li>A passive therapy. You are expected and required to participate in assessments and treatments.
                        Multiple
                        different
                        positions may occur during a single session so wearing athletic clothing is required. Research
                        shows quicker
                        and longer
                        lasting changes occur when you are actively engaged in your care.</li>
                    <li>A full body session. Although I am looking at the body as a whole and treating it as a whole, I
                        will not
                        work on every
                        single area. Specific muscles or joint areas are addressed as needed based on the findings from
                        my assessment.
