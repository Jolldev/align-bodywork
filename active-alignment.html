                    <p>
                        Sick of that reoccurring pain in your shoulder blade or low back? Frustrated that you can’t get
                        up off the floor easily
                        anymore? Deal with tension headaches on a regular basis? Shoulder or hip mobility limiting you
                        from hitting a PR in that
                        lift? Can’t turn your neck without it hurting?
                    </p>

                    <p> Active Alignment was designed for you. The person that is ready to take charge of their life and
                        say enough is enough.
                        Pain and limited functional mobility do not need to limit you from living your best life & doing
                        all the things you love
                        to do. A comprehensive assessment and treatment approach; looking at the body as a whole &
                        providing you with the tools
                        to continue toward achieving your goals.

                    </h3>
                    <ul class="mt-lg-5">
                        <li>Thorough review of your intake form. Open discussion of health & injury history, short &
                            long-term goals, and current
                            daily habits (activity, hydration, stress levels, sleep quality, nutrition, etc.).</li>
                        <li> Detailed static & dynamic/functional assessment of the body + specific orthopedic testing
                            depending on your personal
                            goals.</li>
                        <li> Bodywork! This can include any & all techniques I offer that you are comfortable with –
                            PNMT, cup therapy/myofascial
                            decompression, scraping, Myoskeletal Alignment Techniques, and more! With this work, and for
                            the best results, you are
                            expected to actively participate throughout the sessions.</li>
                        <li> Education & instruction on self-mobility techniques and corrective exercises to complete
                            between sessions tailored
                            specifically to your goals.</li>
                        <li> Collaborative discussion on findings from evaluation + what is a realistic continued
                            frequency for future sessions.</li>

                </h3>
                <ul class="mt-lg-5">
                    <li>A diagnosis. All the evaluation and assessment that occurs is to help clue me into what muscles
                        & structures
                        of the
                        body are involved and not performing as well as they could be. Doctors, Physical Therapists, or
                        Chiropractors are the
                        ones you need to see if something serious is going on & a diagnosis needs to occur. I can help
                        with knowing
                        when that
                        referral might be needed.</li>
                    <li>A passive therapy. You are expected and required to participate in assessments & treatments.
                        Multiple
                        different
                        positions may occur during a single session so wearing athletic clothing is required. Research
                        shows quicker
                        and longer
                        lasting changes occur when you are actively engaged in your care.</li>
                    <li>A full body session. Although I am looking at the body as a whole and treating it as a whole, I
                        will not
                        work on every
                        single area. Specific muscles or joint areas are addressed as needed based on the findings from
                        assessments.

                        check-ins + accountability to ensure the exercises and lifestyle changes are working well for
                        you or what we can do to
                        make things better.</li>
                    <li>Don't have a gym membership or exercise equipment at home? No worries. I will work with what you
                        do have and even
                        provide some bands if those are the best corrective exercises that we feel you need.</li>
                    <li>Upon completion of your evaluation, you will also receive an exclusive Align Bodywork massage
                        ball so you have the
